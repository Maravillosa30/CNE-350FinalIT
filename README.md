# Running QBittorent on Raspberry Pi

This project was used to replace the Original Project that consisted on using the Raspberry Pi as a Media Center using OSMC (a super lightweight line bistro with a custom version of Kodi installed). 


For the fisrt project, this tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngGkVd-_LP8&t=301s] was used to download and try to run this software on the Pi.


When the Raspberry was booted, it  showed a rainbow screen. After several congifuration failed, moving on to a new project was the best option.
