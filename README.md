# Running QBittorent on Raspberry Pi

qBittorent is one of the most popular torrent clients that you can use on the Pi.
It has become known for its relatively stable platform and good feature set that works well on limited-resource devices like the Raspberry Pi.

BitTorrent trackers provide a list of files available for transfer and allow the client to find peer users, known as "seeds", who may transfer the files. 

### Explanation on Project change.
